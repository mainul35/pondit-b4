## Points to note
1. Interface is a common point of contract when we think of building an application with different implementations.
2. An interface can extend multiple interfaces
3. An interface can never contain methods with body, except for static, private and default methods. (See ChatRoom class definition in class 11)
4. An interface must contain only the minimum amount of methods that are very specifically required to perform an individual responsibility.
